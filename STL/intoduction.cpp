// STL (Standard Template Library) is a library of components that are commonly used in C++
// It is like a big box of tools that you can use when building things with C++
// Inside STL toolbox there are lots of useful tools (components) to help you work with different kinds of data

// CONTAINERS
// Containers are boxes in which we store data that requires processing
// The most commonly used containers are vector, list, map, set, stack, queue, etc.
// Each container provides different capabilities and benefits

// ALGORITHMS
// Using algorithms to process data
// There are multiple algorithms already included in STL (sorting, searching, grouping, comparing the data, etc)

// FUNCTION OBJECTS (FUNCTORS)
// STL comes with a lof of included algorithms, but if we want to include our own custom algorithms, we can do that using Functors.
// Functor is a custom implementation of algorithm
// STL knows how to sort numbers by default, but it doesn't know how to sort Students or some other custom data type
// To sort students by grade we can modify the Sort algorithm with our custom logic, and for that we use functors

// ITERATORS
// Iterators are used for navigating through the data inside containers

// Recap
// CONTAINERS are used to store the data
// ALGORITHMS are used to process the data
// FUNCTORS are used to write custom algorithms
// ITERATORS are used to navigate through the data
// ALL OF THEM are part of STL

// Templates
//  STL is very efficient because it uses Templates
//  Templates are generic code. They allow us to write a single piece of code that can work with different data types
//  For example, with templates, we can write just one function, but it will work with multiple data.
